Delphi-fabric
---------------------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/davidkhala/delphi-fabric.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/davidkhala/delphi-fabric)

About
-----------------------
**This project is not related to delphi program language**

This project aims to provide a user-friendly fabric application development toolset including
- fabric network simulation (alternative of **Build your first network**)
- chaincode lifecycle tools
- adopt stateless fashion when using multiple fabric-sdk, to power fabric *proxy server* second-development     
- as a major integration testing environment for [fabric-common](https://github.com/davidkhala/fabric-common), which is 
a pure helper to fabric-sdk user.


Why
-----------------------
- No multiple config file confusing anymore. All magic in `orgs.json` and `chaincode.json`  
    - no crypto-config.yaml
    - no docker-compose.yaml
    - auto-generated and managed configtx.yaml and genesis blocks for each channel. 
    - named docker volume to avoid infinite file path hell
- No need to copy and paste to have a proper connection profile from existing network. Now you are simulation your own network
- No need to global find all appearance of `org1` and replace it with `orgA`, organization names and mspid are put together
- Forget to cleanup legacy configs after you restart your network? 
    It is impossible here thanks to our carefully tested cleaning-up process
- Production-level and long run maintenance
    - This project is the research facility of a active blockchain product
- Perfect same crypto-material file structure as you use `cryptogen`. We have place fabric-ca response in good manner.

Features
-----------------------
- use fabric-ca to generate all crypto material, instead of cryptogen
- use config-less fabric-ca
- use `npm dockerode` to run docker container with comprehensive JSON configuration file, instead of `docker-compose` on yaml file
- JSON config cater for both application and network structure (superset of connection profile and network-yaml)
- channel update support (including system channel)
- chaincode language support
   - nodeJS
   - golang
- Fixed security leakage (wallet remaining) on development machine: priv-file, crypto-store in .hfc-key-store
- support hybrid data storage model (couchdb|leveldb), you could specify it for each peer
- update anchor peers as a normal channel config instead of using `configtx`
- use npm:js-yaml to read|write YAML files instead of jq 

Major configuration
-----------------------
 - we cluster network and channel config in ``config/orgs.json``, enjoy!
 - chaincodes configurations: ``config/chaincode.json``

Installation
-----------------------


**Installation Script**
1. `$ ./install.sh gitSync`   
_after first time clone this repository, submodule should be initialize_
2. `$ ./install.sh`

----
 
**Requirements & dependencies**
  *  **Compatible OS** 
    - ubuntu xenial/bionic
    - [TODO] MacOS 
  * fabric: 2.1.0 (for docker image, binary tool and fabric-sdk)
  * fabric-ca: 1.4.6
  * docker-ce 18.x
  * golang 1.12 
  * node 10.17, npm 6.11 : npm installÂç°Ê≠ªÁöÑËØùÔºåÂèØ‰ª•ËÄÉËôëÊ∑ªÂä†Ê∑òÂÆùÁöÑÊ∫ê
        - ``$ npm config set registry  https://registry.npm.taobao.org/``
  * java 1.8.0_151 (optional for java-sdk)
  * jq 1.5Ôºöa command line tool for parsing json format https://github.com/mikefarah/yq

Test on single host
-----------------------
 * run `$ ./docker.sh` to restart network


Finished
-----------------------
- use npm:js-yaml to write YAML files instead of jq
- new orderer with same org
- chaincode version,ID string RegX
- hybrid data storage model: couchdb, leveldb

## TODO
- migrate to use `mocha` as test framework
- java sdk: keep update
- java chaincode
- chaincode uninstall
- 1.3: idemixgen
- migrate to use make file instead of ./install.sh (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction)
- chaincode "Indy": a fabric chaincode implementation of all claimed features of Hyperledger/indy
- Suggestion from Paul: Question: are your repos more to do with Fabric itself, rather than pure Fabric developer resources (ie go/js/java/typescript chaincode/sdk work)? (I'm only concentrating on Fabric Developer resources in particular) If so - I would suggest to contact someone like Silona Bonewald to find a suitable home/new page on Confluence for that? I'm just asking where its 'natural' home is üôÇ Also I would suggest the README explains 1) what it is 2) what it does (as a goal of 'studying Fabric' resources) 3) what the consumer would get from trying it out or hope to achieve?
- CRl: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/msp.html?highlight=CRL#msp-setup-on-the-peer-orderer-side
- system upgrade: how to migrate to 1.4. from 1.1
- ÂºÄÂèëÊ®°Âºè:--peer-chaincodedev: try to set via core.yaml
- configtxlator Rest server is deprecated but kept. Refer to following when reuse 
    ```
      const binManager = new BinManager();
      await binManager.configtxlatorRESTServer('down|start');
    ```
 
## New feature, patch required for node-sdk
 
- feature: implement configtx in node-sdk??
- patch: configtxgen binary allow upper case channelName
- fabric-ca: cannot change csr.cn via '--csr.cn=${container_name}' TLS CSR: {CN:example.com Names:[{C:US ST:North Carolina L: O:Hyperledger OU:Fabric SerialNumber:}] Hosts:[02cf209b65fb localhost] KeyRequest:<nil> CA:<nil> SerialNumber:}
 
## Abandoned tasks
- docker volume plugin
- endorsement policy config: too flexible to build template
- docker swarm deployment
- cooperate with official network_config.json
- adding kafka/zookeeper online: use etcdRaft
- [grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
